ImageLabeler is a Qt 5.7 project built to aid image data preparation for the AUVSI SUAS competition. The goal is to create a program which displays images in a directory and presents a GUI to allow quick labeling. The program will export data into a format (JSON?) which may subsequently be preprocessed as necessary by an external script.
